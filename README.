**Refactor Homework for Coding Course**
This homework gives students the ability to create a functional one page website that has an aside, header, nav, sections and a footer. The site is built on HTML & CSS, and before beginning the assignment, there was initial code from the teacher to get us started.

The motivation for this project comes from wanting a great grade in my Columbia University class. In order for me to become a strong developer, lots of practice and use tactics must go into my creations. I could argue that I've been a front end developer for two years and now is the time where I have the time to grow and strengthen new coding skill. So here we are! An HTML digital marketing project page.

Currently, this site is bare bones. Code style: standard. No screenshots are available because the site's simplicity does not necessitate such.

This code is built entirely on VS Code: pulled from gitlab and pushed to Github.

You run this program by clicking on the action link below. No further steps are necessary.

Here's how you can run tests.

Finally, we welcome your contributions to our project. If interested, please review our contributing guideline here.

Special thanks to Teacher 1 and Teacher two for helping me to get this far so fast. As I grow with you, I thank you.
